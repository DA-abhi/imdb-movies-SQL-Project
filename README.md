##  Business Problem and Solutions
### 1. A film production company wants to classify its movie portfolio based on revenue performance to better understand historical trends and guide future investments. Management has defined the following revenue-based segmentation:
### * Blockbuster: Revenue ≥ 300 million
### * Superhit: Revenue between 200 and 299.99 million
### * Hit: Revenue between 100 and 199.99 million
### * Normal: Revenue < 100 million
### The marketing team is specifically interested in evaluating the performance of their releases from the year 2014.
### They want to know how many movies released in 2014 fall under the 'Superhit' category to assess that year’s return on mid-tier investments.
