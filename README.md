##  Business Problem and Solutions
#### 1. A company wants to classify its movie portfolio based on revenue performance to better understand historical trends and guide future investments. Management has defined the following revenue-based segmentation:
* Blockbuster: Revenue ≥ 300 million
* Superhit: Revenue between 200 and 299.99 million
* Hit: Revenue between 100 and 199.99 million
* Normal: Revenue < 100 million
 The marketing team is specifically interested in evaluating the performance of their releases from the year 2014.
They want to know how many movies released in 2014 fall under the 'Superhit' category to assess that year’s return on mid-tier investments.

```Sql
SELECT Count(*) AS ` ‘Superhit’ in the year 2014`
FROM   (SELECT *,
               CASE
                 WHEN revenue_millions >= 300 THEN 'Blockbuster'
                 WHEN revenue_millions BETWEEN 200 AND 299.99THEN 'Superhit'
                 WHEN revenue_millions BETWEEN 100 AND 199.99 THEN 'Hit'
                 ELSE 'Normal'
               end AS 'Ratings'
        FROM   imdb_movies
        WHERE  year = 2014
        HAVING `ratings` = 'Superhit') a;
```
**Objective:** To determine the number of 'Superhit' movies released in the year 2014 by classifying films based on their revenue using a CASE WHEN logic.

#### 2.Calculate the total revenue from 'Blockbuster' movies (revenue ≥ 300M) released in 2015 to assess top-tier film performance for that year.
```Sql
SELECT Round(Sum(revenue_millions), 2) AS
       `total revenue of the Blockbuster movies in the year 2015`
FROM   (SELECT *,
               CASE
                 WHEN revenue_millions >= 300 THEN 'Blockbuster'
                 WHEN revenue_millions BETWEEN 200 AND 299.99THEN 'Superhit'
                 WHEN revenue_millions BETWEEN 100 AND 199.99 THEN 'Hit'
                 ELSE 'Normal'
               end AS 'Ratings'
        FROM   imdb_movies
        WHERE  year = 2015
        HAVING `ratings` = 'Blockbuster') a; 
```

**Objective:** To compute the total revenue generated by Blockbuster movies in the year 2015 for financial performance analysis.

#### 3. A company wants to enhance its movie recommendation system by segmenting its catalog based on viewer ratings. To achieve this, movies are categorized as:
* Must Watch: Rating ≥ 8
* Can Watch: Rating between 6 and 7.9
* Avoid: Rating < 6
The content strategy team is specifically interested in knowing how many movies in the entire dataset qualify as ‘Must Watch’, so they can prioritize promoting high-rated content to users and allocate marketing efforts accordingly.
```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM   (SELECT *,
               IF(rating >= 8, 'Must Watch',
               IF(rating BETWEEN 6 AND 7.9, 'Can Watch',
               'Avoid')
               ) AS Ratings
        FROM   imdb_movies) a 
WHERE Ratings = 'Must Watch';
```
**Objective:** To determine the total number of 'Must Watch' movies (rating ≥ 8) in the dataset for use in content recommendation and promotional strategy.
